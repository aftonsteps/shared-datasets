# shared-datasets
A place to share datasets with one another! I'm using this as a place for us to share datasets for a data visualization stream on Twitch. :)

Rules:
- Make sure your dataset has no adult content! This is for a family-friendly stream.
- To add a new dataset, just fork this repo, add your data, and make a pull request.
- Let's follow this strucutre when adding new data: Create a new folder for your dataset, and inside that folder add whatever you think is relevant (the dataset, metadata, docs, etc.). Let's avoid putting datasets at the highest-level directory. Thanks!
